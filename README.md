# EasyNanoMeta:A pipeline for nanopore long-read metagenomic analysis

With the widespread application of nanopore sequencing in microbiology, there has been a significant increase in the generation of long-read sequencing data. This poses a challenge in effectively mining valuable biological information from the vast amount of nanopore sequencing data using bioinformatics tools. In this review, we present the advantages and pitfalls of long-read nanopore sequencing technologies in microbial genome and microbiome research, systematically summarize the bioinformatics analysis methods for nanopore long-read metagenomics and validate the practical implementation of the analysis workflow using various simulated and experimental metagenomic datasets. In addition, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the overall performance and computational requirement of various bioinformatic tools.
