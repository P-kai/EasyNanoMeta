With the widespread application of nanopore sequencing in microbiology, there has been a significant increase in the generation of long-read sequencing data. This poses a challenge in effectively mining valuable biological
information from the vast amount of nanopore sequencing data using bioinformatics tools. 
Here, we present EasyNanoMeta, a pipeline for nanopore microbiome analysis.
