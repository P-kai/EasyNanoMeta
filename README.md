## Abstract

With its critical role in human health and disease, the microbiome has transformed modern biology. Over the past few years, microbiome research has evolved rapidly, with microbiologists gradually shifting their focus from cataloging microorganisms in the human microbiome to understanding their functional roles and how they interact with the host. Here, we present the global trends in microbiome research and summarize the past and current work on microbiome published in *Protein & Cell*. In closing, we highlight some of the major advancements in microbiome research, including technical, practical, and conceptual advancements, that aim to enhance disease diagnosis, medicine development, and personalized interventions.

The paper contains the following figures, and these scripts contain codes of all statistics and plotting figures.

**Fig. 1c | Bar graph displaying the year-over-year growth rate of the five countries with the most microbiome-related publications over the past five years.**

Year-over-year growth rate is calculated as follows: (the amount of the year’s publications—the amount of the last-year’s publications)/the amount of the last-year’s publications × 100%.

### Figure1d Bubbleplot

**Fig. 1d | Bubble plot showing the citation indexes of journals citing publications from the first two special issues of *****Protein*** & ***Cell***.

Citation index is calculated as follows: the number of citations that a journal has made to the publications × the journal impact factor (IF) in 2021.
